#### Description:

* This project is a part of the course "Machine Learning"
  at [University Paris Dauphine, PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/).

#### Content:

* [Problem 1: Implementation Logistic Regression and LDA](#)
* [Problem 2: Working with real-world data to evaluate implemented models](#)

#### Execution:

* Requirements: `Python 3.6`, `pip`, `virtualenv` or `conda`
* Setup necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Main file to run: `python src/main.py` or notebook `Notebooks/*.ipynb`

#### TODO:

* [ ] Implement LDA
* [ ] Implement Logistic Regression
* [ ] Understand the data and comprehend the problem
* [ ] Data analysis with visualization in R, Python

* [ ] About outliers? (remove or not?)
* [ ] Implement data transformation and feature engineering
* [ ] Implement model evaluation, metrics, and hyperparameter tuning
* [ ] Test the LDA and Logistic Regression models with post-processing data
* [ ] Test the LDA and Logistic Regression models with pre-processing data
* [ ] Tuning the hyperparameters of Logistic Regression
* [ ] Evaluate the models and implement SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost
* [ ] Implement the ensemble model and compare the results
* [ ] Interpret the results
* [ ] Write the report
