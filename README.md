#### Description:

* This project is a part of the course "Machine Learning"
  at [University Paris Dauphine, PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/).

#### Content:

* [Problem 1: Implementation Logistic Regression and LDA](#)
* [Problem 2: Working with real-world data to evaluate implemented models](#)

#### Execution:

* Requirements: `Python 3.6`, `pip`, `virtualenv` or `conda`
* Setup necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Main file to run: `python src/main.py` or notebook `Notebooks/*.ipynb`
