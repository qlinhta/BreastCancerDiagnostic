#### Description:

* This project is a part of the course "Machine Learning"
  at [University Paris Dauphine, PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/).

#### Content:

* [Problem 1: Implementation Logistic Regression and LDA](#)
* [Problem 2: Working with real-world data to evaluate implemented models](#)

#### Execution:

* Requirements: `Python 3.6`, `pip`, `virtualenv` or `conda`
* Setup necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Main file to run: `python src/main.py` or notebook `Notebooks/*.ipynb`

#### Project structure:

* `src/`: source code
* `src/output_models/`: output models
* `src/output_plots/`: output plots
* `src/logistic_missed_predict_investigate/`: HTML files for investigating
  missed predictions of logistic regression
* `AREA51/`: test and debug code
* `dataset/`: data files
* `Notebooks/`: notebooks
* `plots/`: analysis plots
* `Analysis.R/`: R scripts for analysis
* `README.md`: this file
* `requirements.txt`: list of necessary packages
